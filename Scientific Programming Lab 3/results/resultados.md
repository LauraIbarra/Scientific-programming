# Results

This folder contains all the final outputs generated by the project’s full analytical pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory inspection, spectral analysis, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, clustering, classification, and statistical evaluation.

The results are organized into two subfolders:

---

## 1. `figures/`

This directory includes all graphical outputs generated automatically from the notebooks and the visualization module.  
The figures summarize the main behaviors, transformations, and patterns identified throughout the project.

### The folder contains:

- **physicochemical_overview.png / physicochemical_distribution.png**  
  Visual summaries of the raw physicochemical measurements (BOD, COD, TOC, NO₃, TN, turbidity), showing distributions, variability, and potential anomalies.

- **spectral_raw.png / spectral_snv.png**  
  UV–Vis spectra before and after preprocessing (e.g., SNV normalization).  
  These figures highlight how preprocessing improves consistency and removes scattering effects.

- **analysis_domain_*.png**  
  Visualizations of spectral domain partitioning, showing how wavelength regions were grouped or summarized for feature extraction.  
  Used later for PCA, clustering, and classification.

- **analysis_index_*.png**  
  Plots of spectral indices computed from specific wavelength ratios or band combinations.  
  These help evaluate chemically meaningful relationships within the spectra.

- **analysis_correlation_*.png**  
  Correlation heatmaps comparing:  
  - physicochemical variables  
  - spectral-derived features  
  - domain averages  
  These plots reveal which variables are most strongly related and where redundancy exists.

- **analysis_pca_clusters.png**  
  PCA score plots showing sample distribution in reduced dimensions.  
  Useful for identifying trends, separation between groups, and underlying variance in spectral data.

- **analysis_cluster_structure.png**  
  Visual evaluation of clustering results, showing group assignments and cluster cohesion across PCA dimensions.

These figures collectively form the visual interpretation layer of the project, supporting the findings presented in the notebooks and documentation.

## 2. `tables/`

This directory contains all structured numerical outputs generated during analysis.  
Each `.csv` file corresponds to results produced during preprocessing, PCA, correlation analysis, statistical testing, clustering, or classification tasks.

### The folder contains:

- **anova_results.csv**  
  ANOVA statistical outcomes used to evaluate significant differences across variables or sample groups.

- **classification_metrics.csv**  
  Performance scores from supervised classification models (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix summaries).  
  These metrics quantify how well spectral features predict physicochemical categories or sample classifications.

- **cluster_scores.csv**  
  Numerical evaluation of clustering quality (silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, inertia, etc.).  
  Helps validate how well the samples group based on spectral or physicochemical similarities.

- **correlation_matrix.csv**  
  Pairwise correlations between physicochemical measurements, spectral features, and domain summaries.  
  Used to detect redundancy, identify meaningful relationships, and guide feature selection.

- **domain_indexes.csv / domain_summary.csv**  
  Numerical summaries of spectral domains (mean absorbance per region, ratios, indexes derived from specific wavelengths).  
  These are the features used for PCA and clustering.

- **features_phys_chem.csv**  
  Feature table combining physicochemical parameters with spectral-derived metrics, used for integrated analysis.

- **fisher_ratio.csv**  
  Fisher discriminant values for evaluating the discriminative power of each spectral region or feature.

- **merged_physicochemical_spectral.csv**  
  Full merged dataset containing physicochemical data aligned with spectral features after preprocessing.

- **pca_components.csv**  
  PCA loadings and explained variance per component, showing which wavelengths or variables contribute most to sample separation.

These tables provide the quantitative backbone of the project and allow reproducibility, further analysis, and transparent reporting of all results.

## Summary

The `results/` folder consolidates every numerical and graphical output generated from the complete workflow.  
Together, the figures and tables form the evidence supporting the project’s interpretation, statistical results, and final conclusions.
